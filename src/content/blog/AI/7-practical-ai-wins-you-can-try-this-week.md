AI is everywhere in the news. The part that matters is this: it can save time when used for clear, repeatable tasks. Below are seven easy wins to try this week, plus simple guardrails to keep things safe.

1) Draft better emails in 60 seconds
Paste key points and ask for a first draft in your tone.

Prompt idea: “Keep it short, friendly, and action‑oriented.”

Always do a quick edit. It’s a helper, not a final writer.

2) Summarize long docs without losing context
Give a goal: “Summarize decisions and next steps.”

Ask for bullet points and a short action list.

If the doc is sensitive, remove names and private details first.

3) Clean and standardize data before analysis
Ask AI to fix typos, unify labels, and normalize dates.

Keep a “before/after” snapshot so you can trust the changes.

Never paste personal or confidential information.

4) Turn raw notes into reusable checklists
Feed messy meeting notes; ask for a step‑by‑step checklist.

Save it as a template for similar tasks next week.

5) Brainstorm headlines and taglines
Give three audience types and ask for 10 headline ideas each.

Combine two you like, then rewrite in your voice.

6) Build a simple idea‑to‑draft pipeline
Idea → Prompt → Outline → Draft → Edit → Publish.

Reuse the outline prompt so your posts stay consistent.

7) Add lightweight guardrails (privacy + safety)
Strip sensitive data before prompting.

Ask for sources when claims are made.

Keep a “do/don’t” prompt list and stick to it.

Copy‑and‑use prompts
“Rewrite this in plain English. Keep it to 5 bullets and 1 action line.”

“Summarize decisions, blockers, and deadlines from this text.”

“Turn these notes into a step‑by‑step checklist with clear verbs.”
