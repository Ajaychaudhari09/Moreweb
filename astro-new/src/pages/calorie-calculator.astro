      <h2>How Does the Calorie Calculator Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Our calculator uses the <strong>Mifflin-St Jeor equation</strong>, widely considered one of the most accurate formulas for estimating calorie needs. It calculates your <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)</strong>—the calories your body burns at rest—and multiplies it by an activity factor to find your <strong>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding BMR vs. TDEE</h2>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-orange-600 mb-2">BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">The energy required for essential functions like breathing, circulation, and cell production while you are completely at rest.</p>

          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-orange-600 mb-2">TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Your BMR plus the calories burned through daily movement, exercise, and the digestion of food.</p>

      <h2>Calorie Goals Explained</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Eating at your TDEE. Your weight remains stable.</li>
        <li><strong>Deficit (Weight Loss):</strong> Eating 300-500 calories <em>below</em> your TDEE. This typically results in 0.5kg - 1kg of weight loss per week.</li>
        <li><strong>Surplus (Weight Gain):</strong> Eating 300-500 calories <em>above</em> your TDEE. Essential for building significant muscle mass.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips for Accurate Tracking</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Use a Food Scale:</strong> Measuring cups can be inaccurate. Weighing food in grams is the gold standard.</li>
        <li><strong>Track Everything:</strong> Don't forget cooking oils, sauces, and liquid calories (drinks), which add up quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Consistent:</strong> Tracking for one day won't tell you much. Look at weekly averages to gauge progress.</li>
      </ol>

            For weight loss, total daily calories matter more than when you eat them. However, eating protein throughout the day helps maintain muscle mass.

            You might be underestimating your intake (hidden calories) or overestimating your activity level. Water retention and stress can also mask fat loss on the scale.
