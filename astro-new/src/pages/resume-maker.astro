      </p>

      <h2>What is an ATS-Friendly Resume?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)</strong> are software used by employers to scan and rank resumes before a human ever reads them. To pass the ATS, your resume needs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean Formatting:</strong> No complex columns, graphics, or tables that confuse the parser.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Headings:</strong> Use standard terms like "Experience," "Education," and "Skills."</li>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Include relevant skills and terms found in the job description.</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Use Action Verbs</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Start bullet points with strong verbs like "Led," "Developed," "Increased," or "Optimized" instead of "Responsible for."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Quantify Results</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Numbers speak louder than words. Instead of "Improved sales," say "Increased sales by 20% in Q3."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Tailor Content</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Customize your summary and skills section for each job application to match the specific requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Keep it Concise</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Aim for 1 page if you have less than 10 years of experience. Recruiters spend only seconds scanning each resume.</p>
