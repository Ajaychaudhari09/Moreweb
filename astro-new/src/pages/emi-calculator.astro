      <h2>What is an Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)?</h2>
      <p>
        An <strong>Equated Monthly Installment (EMI)</strong> is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. Equated monthly installments are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMIs are a convenient way to pay for large expenses like a home, car, or personal needs without feeling the burden of a lump-sum payment.
      </p>

      <h2>How is EMI Calculated?</h2>
      <p>
        The mathematical formula for calculating EMI is:
      </p>
      <div class="bg-slate-100 p-4 rounded-lg text-center font-mono my-6">
        E = P x r x (1+r)<sup>n</sup> / ((1+r)<sup>n</sup> - 1)
      </div>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>E</strong> is the EMI</li>
        <li><strong>P</strong> is the Principal Loan Amount</li>
        <li><strong>r</strong> is the monthly interest rate (Annual Rate / 12 / 100)</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> is the loan tenure in months</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Factors Affecting Your Loan EMI</h2>
      <p>
        Several key factors influence the amount you pay each month:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Principal Amount:</strong> The total amount you borrow. Higher principal leads to higher EMI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interest Rate:</strong> The rate at which the bank lends you money. Even a small difference in rate can significantly impact your total interest outgo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loan Tenure:</strong> The duration of the loan. A longer tenure reduces your monthly EMI but increases the total interest paid over the life of the loan. Conversely, a shorter tenure increases EMI but saves on total interest.
        </li>
      </ul>

            Yes, if you have opted for a floating interest rate loan, your EMI may change based on market fluctuations. For fixed-rate loans, the EMI usually remains constant.

            Not necessarily. While a longer tenure reduces your monthly EMI amount, it significantly increases the total interest you pay over the loan period.

            Yes, making prepayments reduces your outstanding principal, which in turn reduces the total interest burden. Check with your lender for any prepayment charges.
