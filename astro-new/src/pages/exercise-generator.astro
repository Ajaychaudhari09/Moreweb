      <h2>Why You Need a Structured Workout Plan</h2>
      <p>
        Walking into a gym (or your living room) without a plan often leads to wasted time and suboptimal results. A <strong>Workout Generator</strong> removes the guesswork by creating a balanced routine that targets all major muscle groups, ensuring you make consistent progress without overtraining.

      <h2>Choosing the Right Fitness Level</h2>
      <div class="grid sm:grid-cols-3 gap-6 my-8 not-prose">
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-700 mb-2">Beginner</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Focuses on mastering form, building a base level of strength, and establishing a habit. Lower intensity and volume.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-700 mb-2">Intermediate</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Introduces more complex movements, higher volume, and split routines (e.g., Upper/Lower) to break through plateaus.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl border shadow-sm">
          <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-700 mb-2">Advanced</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">High intensity and volume. Uses advanced techniques like supersets and dropsets to maximize hypertrophy and strength.</p>
        </div>

      <h2>Home vs. Gym Workouts</h2>
      <p>
        The best workout is the one you can stick to.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home Workouts:</strong> Convenient and time-saving. Bodyweight exercises (calisthenics) can be incredibly effective for building lean muscle and endurance.</li>
        <li><strong>Gym Workouts:</strong> Access to weights and machines allows for progressive overload, which is generally more efficient for building maximum muscle mass and raw strength.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Importance of Recovery</h2>
      <p>
        Muscles grow while you rest, not while you train. Ensure you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sleep 7-9 hours per night.</li>
        <li>Eat enough protein to repair muscle tissue.</li>
        <li>Take rest days to prevent burnout and injury.</li>
      </ul>

            Yes! Exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, squats, and lunges build significant strength and muscle. To keep progressing, you'll need to do harder variations or increase reps.

            Don't stress. Just get back on track the next day. Consistency over months and years is what counts, not a single missed session.
