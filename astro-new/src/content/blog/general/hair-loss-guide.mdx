# Hair Loss Explained: Causes, Treatments, and Prevention

Hair loss (alopecia) is a common concern that can affect anyone, regardless of age or gender. While often dismissed as a cosmetic issue, it can significantly impact self-esteem and may signal underlying health conditions. This guide breaks down the science of hair growth, common types of hair loss, and evidence-based treatments.

## The Hair Growth Cycle

To understand hair loss, you must understand how hair grows. Every follicle goes through three stages:

1.  **Anagen (Growth Phase):** Lasts 2-7 years. 85-90% of your hair is in this phase.
2.  **Catagen (Transition Phase):** Lasts about 2 weeks. The follicle shrinks.
3.  **Telogen (Resting Phase):** Lasts 2-4 months. The hair falls out, and a new one begins to grow.

Hair loss occurs when this cycle is disrupted or the follicle is destroyed.

## Common Types of Hair Loss

### 1. Androgenetic Alopecia (Pattern Baldness)
This is the most common cause, affecting 50 million men and 30 million women in the US alone.
*   **Cause:** Genetics and hormones (DHT).
*   **Symptoms:** Receding hairline and thinning crown in men; overall thinning in women.
*   **Treatment:** Minoxidil (Rogaine), Finasteride (Propecia), Hair Transplants.

### 2. Telogen Effluvium
A temporary form of hair loss triggered by stress or shock to the body.
*   **Triggers:** Childbirth, severe illness (like COVID-19), rapid weight loss, or extreme stress.
*   **Symptoms:** Sudden, diffuse shedding (handfuls of hair coming out).
*   **Treatment:** Usually resolves on its own once the stressor is removed.

### 3. Alopecia Areata
An autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks hair follicles.
*   **Symptoms:** Smooth, round patches of baldness.
*   **Treatment:** Corticosteroid injections, immunotherapy.

## Prevention and Scalp Health

While you can't change your genetics, you can maintain a healthy environment for hair growth.

### Nutrition
Your hair needs fuel. Deficiencies in these nutrients can lead to shedding:
*   **Iron:** Essential for carrying oxygen to follicles.
*   **Vitamin D:** crucial for follicle cycling.
*   **Protein:** Hair is made of keratin (a protein).
*   **Zinc:** Supports tissue repair.

### Scalp Care
*   **Keep it Clean:** Sebum buildup can clog follicles.
*   **Avoid Heat:** Excessive blow-drying and ironing damage the hair shaft.
*   **Gentle Styling:** Tight hairstyles (braids, ponytails) can cause **Traction Alopecia**.

## When to See a Doctor
If you notice:
*   Sudden, patchy hair loss.
*   Redness, scaling, or pain on the scalp.
*   Hair loss accompanied by fatigue or weight changes (could be thyroid-related).

## Conclusion
Hair loss is complex, but it is not always permanent. By identifying the type and cause early, you can choose the most effective treatment plan. Prioritize your health, manage stress, and consult a professional to keep your hair healthy and strong.
