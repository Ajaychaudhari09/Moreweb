    <span>🧘</span> The Attention Economy
  </h2>
  <p className="text-sm">
    The average human attention span has dropped to <strong>6 seconds</strong> in 2026. The algorithm knows you better than your spouse. Fighting it with "willpower" is like bringing a knife to a nuclear war.

Digital Minimalism isn't about being a luddite; it's about being intentional. In 2026, the content isn't just curated; it's *generated* on the fly to trigger your specific dopamine receptors.

## The 3-Step Protocol

### 1. The "Dumb Phone" Weekend
You don't need to throw away your iPhone 17. But you should own a "dumb phone" (like the Light Phone III or Punkt MP03). Swap your SIM card on Friday night.
*   **Result:** You will feel phantom vibrations and anxiety for 4 hours. Then, you will feel a strange sense of time slowing down.

### 2. Grayscale Mode 24/7
Your phone is a slot machine. The colors (red badges, bright icons) are designed to stimulate.
*   **IOS/Android Trick:** Set "Color Filters" to Grayscale. Your Instagram feed looks remarkably boring in black and white.

### 3. Physical Media Revival
Vinyl records, paper books, and film cameras are engaging *because* they are friction-heavy. You can't doomscroll a paperback.
*   **Trend:** "Analog Cafes" where Wi-Fi is banned are the fastest-growing coffee shop segment in 2026.

    <strong>Challenge:</strong> Try to eat one meal a day without a screen. No YouTube, no podcast, no texting. Just eat. It’s harder than it sounds.

## Verdict
Technology is a great servant but a terrible master. If you don't schedule time to be offline, the algorithm will schedule your time to be online.
