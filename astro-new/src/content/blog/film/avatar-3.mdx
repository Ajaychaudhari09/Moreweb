James Cameron’s **Avatar: Fire and Ash** (the third Avatar film) is scheduled to premiere on **December 19, 2025**. Set after *Avatar: The Way of Water*, it follows Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their family as they face new dangers on Pandora.

## Plot Overview
Jake and Neytiri are rebuilding life with their children among the Metkayina reef clan. However, a new threat arises when their sky-ships are attacked by the **Ash People** (led by Varang), a hostile Na’vi clan from Pandora’s volcanic regions.

The film introduces "Grey Morality" to the franchise—the Ash People represent nature's destructive wrath, challenging the idea that all Na'vi are benevolent.

*   **Oona Chaplin** as Varang (Leader of the Ash People).
*   **Edie Falco**

*   **Kate Winslet** (in a surprise role).

## Release & Runtime
*   **Release Date:** December 19, 2025.
*   **Runtime:** Approximately 3h 15m.
*   **Rating:** PG-13.
