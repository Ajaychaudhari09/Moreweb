By late 2025, many countries are reassessing their moves to **Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**. Far from a full “digital currency revolution,” the trend is actually a slowdown. According to a 2025 report by OMFIF, roughly **31% of central banks worldwide** have delayed or put a hold on their CBDC plans.

## Countries on Pause
*   **South Korea:** Officially suspended its “digital won” trial.
*   **United Kingdom:** The Bank of England has slowed its “digital pound” development.
*   **South Africa:** Stepped back to focus on modernizing existing payment infrastructure.

These decisions reflect caution rather than abandonment. Officials cite the need for robust privacy, security, and offline features before rolling out national digital currencies.

## Why the Hold?
A major factor is the rise of **stablecoins** and private digital payment tech. Regulators worry that widespread stablecoin use (and unclear crypto regulations) may reduce the immediate need for state-run digital currencies.

In short, experts say CBDCs may come later than early hype suggested. The emphasis in 2025 is on **careful design** and **financial stability**, not rushing.
