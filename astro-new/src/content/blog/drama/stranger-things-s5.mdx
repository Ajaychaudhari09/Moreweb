Netflix’s **Stranger Things** final season began in late 2025. The showrunners split the eight-episode finale into three “volumes”:
1.  **Volume 1:** Premiered on November 26, 2025 (4 episodes).
2.  **Volume 2:** Premiered on December 25, 2025 (3 episodes).
3.  **The Finale:** December 31, 2025 (1 episode).

## The End of an Era
Season 5 continues the saga of the Hawkins kids (now late teens) facing the ultimate Upside Down battle. The stakes are higher than ever, and early reviews have been positive—currently holding an **84%** critic rating.

## Cast & Characters
The main ensemble of Hopper, Joyce, Eleven, Mike, and friends returns. Notable additions include **Linda Hamilton** (Terminator star) as a mysterious new character, plus guest roles for Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, and more.

## Why Watch?
This being the final season, fans should brace for emotional payoffs and plenty of sci-fi action. It’s the conclusion to one of Netflix’s biggest cultural phenomena.
