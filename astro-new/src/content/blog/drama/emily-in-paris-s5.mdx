**Emily in Paris** returned in late 2025 with a globe-trotting fifth season that splits Emily Cooper’s (Lily Collins) time between Paris and her new office in Rome. As creator Darren Star put it, “this season is a tale of two cities: Rome and Paris.”

## Episodes & Setting
All ten episodes dropped on **December 18, 2025**, and are now streaming on Netflix. The season picks up right where Season 4 left off: Emily is opening the Rome branch of her marketing firm, reconnecting with old Parisian friends, and navigating fresh love interests. The vibe is *La Dolce Vita* meets Parisian chic.

## Cast & Characters
Lily Collins headlines as Emily. The returning ensemble includes **Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu** (Sylvie), **Ashley Park** (Mindy), **Lucas Bravo** (Gabriel), and **William Abadie** (Antoine).

Season 5 also introduces new faces:
*   **Bryan Greenberg** as Jake (an American expat in Paris).
*   **Michèle Laroque** as Yvette (Sylvie’s old friend).
*   **Minnie Driver** as Princess Jane (a royal acquaintance of Sylvie).

## What to Expect
Expect plenty of romantic entanglements, fashion drama, and Emily’s signature optimism. Early buzz suggests a continued emphasis on Emily’s career growth and her balancing of multiple romances—especially a new spark with her Italian colleague Marcello.
