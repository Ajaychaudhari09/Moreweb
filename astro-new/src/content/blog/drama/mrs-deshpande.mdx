    🕵️‍♀️ The "Gone Girl" of Pune
  </h2>
  <p className="text-sm">
    Starring <strong>Tabu</strong> in the titular role, this series flips the "damsel in distress" trope on its head. Critics are continually calling it a spiritual successor to <em>Andhadhun</em>, but darker and more twisted.

**Mrs. Deshpande** starts as a conventional drama, lulling viewers into a false sense of security. Anjali Deshpande (Tabu) is a respected woman in her Pune colony. She teaches music, hosts kitty parties, and diligently cares for her ailing husband. Then, one ordinary morning, her husband vanishes without a trace.

## The Plot Twist
When the police investigate, they find that Anjali’s "perfect life" is a complete fabrication. There are no marriage records. The neighbors realize they know absolutely nothing about her past. And then, the police open the basement door.

**Why It Stands Out:**
*   **The Unreliable Narrator:** The story is told entirely from Anjali's perspective, but her reality keeps glitching. Is she protecting herself from a threat, or is she the predator hiding in plain sight?
*   **Tabu's Performance:** Few actors can switch from vulnerable to menacing as seamlessly as Tabu. Her subtle micro-expressions carry the show, making every scene tense.
*   **Social Commentary:** Beneath the thrills, the show critiques how society ignores domestic abuse until it becomes a public spectacle.

## Verdict
This is an absolute **binge-watch**. At only 6 episodes, it is tight, focused, and terrifying. Do not read spoilers before watching—the ending will leave you questioning everything.
