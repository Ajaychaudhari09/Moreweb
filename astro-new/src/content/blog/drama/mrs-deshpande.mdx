**Mrs. Deshpande** is a 2025 Hindi-language drama-thriller series streaming on Disney+ Hotstar. The six-episode show premiered on **December 19, 2025**.

## The Plot
It stars **Madhuri Dixit** as Seema Deshpande, an infamous former serial killer known as "The Mantis." When a new copycat murderer terrorizes the city, Mumbai’s police sergeant Tejas (Siddharth Chandekar) enlists Seema’s help from prison to catch the culprit. The twisty plot—based on the French thriller *La Mante*—unfolds as Seema and her detective son team up to solve the case.

## Format & Review
This Hotstar Special is tightly paced (6 episodes total). The writing alternates between past and present as secrets from Seema’s past and family drama add suspense.

## Cast
Besides Dixit’s chilling turn, the cast includes:
*   **Priyanshu Chatterjee**
*   **Siddharth Chandekar**

The star power and high production values (directed by Nagesh Kukunoor) give the series a polished feel.

## Where to Watch
Stream **Mrs. Deshpande** exclusively on Disney+ Hotstar in India (and on Hulu in some regions).
