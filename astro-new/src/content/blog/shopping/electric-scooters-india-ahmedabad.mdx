# Electric Scooters in Ahmedabad & India 2025: Everything You Need to Know

I'm going to be honest with you—when I started researching electric scooters, I was skeptical. Not because I don't believe in the technology, but because everyone online seems to have an agenda. They're either pushing petrol scooters or trying to sell you the most expensive electric model.

So I decided to do something different. I've spent weeks researching every major electric scooter available in India and Ahmedabad. I've looked at real prices, real-world range from actual owners, charging costs, and long-term value. Here's what I found.

## Why Electric Scooters Make Sense in 2025

Before I dig into specific models, let me explain why electric scooters are becoming a real option in India, especially in Ahmedabad.

### The Cost Argument
Let's do the math. A typical petrol scooter in Ahmedabad costs ₹85,000+ and fuel costs are rising. An EV saves you roughly ₹15,000-₹20,000 per year on fuel alone. Over 5 years, that's ₹70,000-₹100,000 saved.

### The Environment Angle
Ahmedabad's air quality matters. Every vehicle that runs on electricity reduces our collective carbon footprint.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. Which electric scooter is best for Ahmedabad city traffic?
For pure city commuting, the **TVS iQube** or **Ather Rizta** are ideal. They offer excellent ride quality on Ahmedabad's roads, have reliable service networks, and handle stop-and-go traffic efficiently.

### 2. Is there a subsidy for electric scooters in Gujarat in 2025?
Yes, under the PM E-DRIVE scheme and Gujarat's state EV policy, buyers can avail subsidies. On-road prices typically include these benefits, but you can check for additional state-level rebates of up to ₹10,000 depending on the battery size.

### 3. What is the electricity cost to charge a scooter in Ahmedabad?
Charging a standard electric scooter (like Ather or iQube) at home costs roughly **₹15-₹20 per full charge** (approx. 2-3 units of electricity). This gives you ~100 km of range, making the running cost roughly ₹0.20 per km.

### 4. Can I charge my electric scooter in an apartment parking?
Yes, if you have a 15A socket near your parking spot. If not, scooters with **removable batteries** (like the Hero Vida V1 Pro) are the best solution as you can carry the battery up to your flat to charge.

### 5. What is the real-world range of electric scooters in summer?
In Ahmedabad's intense summer heat (40°C+), you might see a slight drop in range (5-10%) due to battery thermal management systems working harder. However, most modern EVs like Ather and TVS handle this well with active cooling.
