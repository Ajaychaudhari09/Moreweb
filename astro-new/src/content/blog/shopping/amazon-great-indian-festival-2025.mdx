The Amazon Great Indian Festival 2025 is here. Whether you are upgrading your tech or restocking home essentials, this is the time to buy.

## 💰 Bank and Payments Stack
To maximize savings, stack these three layers:
1.  **Product Discount:** The slashed price on the page.
2.  **Coupon:** Look for the "Apply Coupon" checkbox.
3.  **Bank Offer:** Use an **SBI Credit/Debit Card** for an extra 10% off.

## 📅 Best Times to Buy

*   **Prime Early Access:** If you have Prime, buy your high-demand items (iPhones, flagship Androids) in the first 2 hours of early access. They sell out fast.
*   **Midnight Drops:** Special "Kickstarter Deals" often drop at midnight.

## 📱 Category Cheat Sheet

### Smartphones
Up to 40% off on brands like Samsung, OnePlus, and Xiaomi.
*   *Looking for a budget phone?* Check our guide on [Best 5G Phones Under ₹15,000](/blog/shopping/5g-phones-15000).

### Laptops & Electronics
Up to 45% off on Windows AI PCs. Look for "No-Cost EMI" offers extended up to 24 months.

### Home Appliances
Up to 65% off on washing machines and ACs. Exchange offers are particularly aggressive this year.

## Pro Tips to Win Deals

1.  **Use Rufus AI:** Amazon's new AI assistant can track price history for you.
2.  **Shortlist Now:** Add items to your wishlist *before* the sale starts to monitor price drops.
3.  **Check Delivery:** Amazon has added 45 new delivery stations for faster delivery in Tier 2/3 cities.
