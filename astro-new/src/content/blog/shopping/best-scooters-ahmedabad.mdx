# Best Scooters in Ahmedabad 2025: A Real Buyer's Guide

I've been riding scooters in Ahmedabad for years now, and I know the struggle. You walk into a dealership and everyone's throwing numbers at you—prices, mileage claims, features—and you're supposed to make a decision right there. I wanted to do something different. I've spent the last few weeks comparing every major scooter available in Ahmedabad, checking official prices, real-world mileage reports, and actual performance data for 2025.

This guide is what I wish I had when I bought my first scooter. I'm not here to sell you anything; I'm just sharing what I've learned so you can make a smart choice.

> **Note on Prices**: The prices listed below are **On-Road Prices in Ahmedabad**. This includes RTO registration, insurance, and other mandatory costs, which is why they look higher than the "Ex-Showroom" prices you see in ads. These are the real numbers you'll actually pay.

## The Top Internal Combustion (Petrol) Scooters

Let me start with the petrol scooters I genuinely think are the best options in Ahmedabad right now. I'm breaking this down by category because different people need different things.

### 1. Honda Activa 6G: The Reliable King

![Best Scooters in Ahmedabad - Comparison Guide showing price, mileage, and specifications](../../../assets/blog/shopping/ahmedabad-scooters.png)

**On-Road Price in Ahmedabad: ₹88,306 - ₹1,04,529**

I have to be honest—the Honda Activa is everywhere in Ahmedabad for a reason. It's not flashy, it's not exciting, but it absolutely works. Every day, I see at least fifty of them on the road.

**Why I'd Choose This:**
The Activa is reliable in a way that almost no other scooter matches. Honda's after-sales service is genuinely good, and parts are dirt cheap if you ever need to fix something.

**The Numbers:**
- **Engine**: 109.51 cc
- **Mileage**: ~48-50 kmpl (Real world)
- **Top Speed**: 90 kmph

### 2. TVS Jupiter 125: The Practical Upgrade

**On-Road Price in Ahmedabad: ₹92,632 - ₹1,04,402**

I really like the Jupiter. It sits in this sweet spot where it's better than the Activa in some ways, offering a 125cc engine for a very competitive price.

**What Makes It Special:**
The Jupiter has a larger 124.8 cc engine, and you genuinely feel that difference. It accelerates a bit quicker and feels more planted. Plus, the under-seat storage is massive because the fuel tank is under the floorboard.

**The Numbers:**
- **Engine**: 124.8 cc
- **Mileage**: ~45-48 kmpl
- **Top Speed**: 95 kmph

### 3. Suzuki Access 125: The Comfort Cruiser

**On-Road Price in Ahmedabad: ₹1,03,419 - ₹1,22,000**

I'll be upfront—the prices have gone up, but the Access 125 remains the most comfortable scooter I've sat on. The seat is wide, and the riding position is perfect for taller riders.

**Why It's Worth Considering:**
If your daily commute involves the SG Highway or longer stretches, your back will thank you for choosing the Access. It's smooth, refined, and powerful.

**The Numbers:**
- **Engine**: 124.3 cc
- **Mileage**: ~40-43 kmpl
- **Top Speed**: 90 kmph

### 4. TVS NTORQ 125: The Sporty Choice

**On-Road Price in Ahmedabad: ₹1,05,827 - ₹1,22,198**

If you want something that looks aggressive and has serious punch, the NTORQ is it. It's the scooter for people who enjoy riding.

**What You're Paying For:**
- Aggressive, sporty design
- Bluetooth connectivity with navigation
- Great acceleration (0-60 in ~9 seconds)

### 5. Hero Destini 125: The Budget Premium

**On-Road Price in Ahmedabad: ₹93,006 - ₹1,01,837**

Updated to a 125cc engine, the new Destini is a fantastic value proposition. It offers premium styling (lots of chrome) and decent power at a price point lower than the Access or Activa 125.
