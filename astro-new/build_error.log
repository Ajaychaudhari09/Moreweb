[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "pdf-lib" from "C:/Users/AJAY CHAUDHARI/OneDrive/Downloads/most/morefusion/astro-new/src/components/pdf-tools/CompressPDF.tsx".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
